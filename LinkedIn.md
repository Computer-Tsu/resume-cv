    - - I was called in to provide a second opinion after the client's IT tech had failed to update the server. Following a tech's attempted upgrade to larger disks, the client could still see their files on the shared folders, but couldn't open most of them.  
  
I traced the events in the RAID card logs, the various Windows logs, and did a low level examination of the file system.  
  
I discovered the model and serial numbers of the drives that the tech had attempted to swap into the RAID array were not certified compatible. I also found that their attempts to restore the multi-terabyte volume had corrupted the "\System Volume Information" folder. The drive's file name listings weren't matched to the files' data.  
  
After explaining my findings, I recovered most of the files and rebuilt the file structure so the company could resume much of their work. I also explained to their hired tech how to correctly restore the backup. The good news is the client did eventually get a complete recovery after that tech accepted help (from the weekend of the attempted upgrade).  
  
If you get called in to provide a second opinion, be polite and professional. Because someday a second opinion may be called in for you. Anyone can have a bad day, make a mistake, or lack some knowledge or experience.I was called in to provide a second opinion after the client's IT tech had failed to update the server.

    - - Starting with empty Office 365 mailbox for a departed employee and worked on multiple approaches to recover needed emails. Microsoft was unsuccessful at recovering the messages. I also ran an eDiscovery search for any items sent to or from the recipient in the company. The third approach was the most successful - I searched for cached copies of the user's mailbox and found two .OST files which were restored to PST and uploaded back to the cloud mailbox. An in-place hold was then put on the mailbox to prevent future loss.Starting with empty Office 365 mailbox for a departed employee and worked on multiple approaches to recover needed emails.

    - - Want to change the DNS server IP address? How do you find every occurrence of hard-coded or statically assigned devices?  
  
Using the debug logs on the DNS servers, I collected several weeks of records and parsed them to find all clients and devices and which DNS server(s) they called. To collate the data and reduce the duplicate events, I first modified a PowerShell script from GitHub which was written to parse SMTP logs. The performance though was very slow. I then wrote an AWK file and it was far faster.  
With the results, we could find and identify all the active devices which weren't configured to DHCP and were not part of the IT inventory or documentation.Want to change the DNS server IP address?
